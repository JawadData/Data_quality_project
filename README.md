## 🏗️ Architecture Overview  

![Project Architecture](archi.png)  

### Key Components and Workflow  

1. **Hadoop HDFS**  
   - The foundation for raw data storage.  
   - Handles large-scale datasets with distributed storage, ensuring high availability and durability.  

2. **Dremio**  
   - A unified data layer.  
   - Fetches raw data from Hadoop and converts it into Parquet format, enabling efficient data querying and exploration.  

3. **Docker**  
   - Containerization solution.  
   - Ensures consistent environments for all tools in the pipeline, from Dremio to Airflow and beyond.

4. **Apache Airflow**  
   - Orchestrates the data pipeline.  
   - Automates workflows like data ingestion, validation, and transformation, ensuring smooth pipeline execution.

5. **Data Lakehouse: Bronze → Silver → Gold**  
   - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data storage.  
   - **Silver Layer**: Data after initial validation and cleansing.  
   - **Gold Layer**: High-quality, business-ready data.  
   - Managed through PostgreSQL and enhanced by PySpark transformations.

6. **PySpark**  
   - Data processing powerhouse.  
   - Performs complex quality checks and applies transformations as data flows from raw to refined stages.

7. **Power BI**  
   - Visualization and storytelling tool.  
   - Creates interactive dashboards and **data stories** that transform raw numbers into meaningful narratives.

## 🔍 Why Focus on Data Quality?  

In this data-driven world, **quality is everything**. Poor data quality leads to misleading insights, while high-quality data enables:  

- **Accurate Decision Making**: Ensure stakeholders have reliable insights.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce rework and manual cleaning efforts.  
- **Enhanced Trust**: Build confidence in data-driven strategies across teams.  

Our pipeline systematically validates data quality at each stage, ensuring only the most reliable data makes its way to the final layer.
